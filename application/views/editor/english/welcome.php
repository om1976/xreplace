<div class="welcome">
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>You are just a couple of steps away from using our editor. You don't even need to register - just add a new category:</p>
    <div><img src="<?php echo base_url('assets/images/faq/en')?>/add-c.png"></div>
    <p>then a group:</p>
    <div><img src="<?php echo base_url('assets/images/faq/en')?>/add-g.png"></div>
    <p>and finally your first replacement rule:</p>
    <div><img src="<?php echo base_url('assets/images/faq/en')?>/add-r.png"></div>
    <p>If it seems too long for you, we've created a sample category full of different types of rules that you can use, edit or delete. Just click "Copy sample category" button:</p>
    <div><img src="<?php echo base_url('assets/images/faq/en')?>/clone.png"></div>
    <p>and start exploring the editor.</p>
    <p>The editor has a lot of features, so don't forget to visit our <a href="<?php echo base_url('index.php/editor/faq') ?>">Guide</a> (for now only in Russian, English version will come soon - check back later) where you can find out how to get the maximum from it.</p>
    <p>Although you don't need to register to try out our editor, if you want to keep the categories/groups/rules you've created you need to register (this doesn't take much time) otherwise you'll lost all of them after you close your browser.</p>
    <p>If you are new at regular expressions we recommend that you visit one of the following useful resources:</p>
    <ul>

    <p>Good luck!</p>
